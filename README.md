# peewee2ods.py

The plan is to make this a script that takes in a [peewee](http://docs.peeewe-orm.com)
model definition file and output an ods file containing details about the
data tables.

Test data is in `test_models.py`; main script is (you guessed it)
`peewee2ods.py`. Run like this:

    python peewee2ods.py path/to/inputfile

That's the plan. It's still work in progress...
